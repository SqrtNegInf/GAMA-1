The compiler option '-fno-realloc-lhs' forces a seg.fault at run-time for lots/most/all of 'allocate' tasks?

Making a point of trying with both 'gfortran' and 'flang', checking for ability to compile, runtime agreement.

Older gfortran doesn't deal with '%' in file names well.

Some non-RC code (e.g. 'fortran-lang.org' examples)
